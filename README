# Object Injection (OI)

This repository contains a collection of scripts and notebooks to perform synthetic
object injection using COSMOS galaxies from GalSim in the bands observed for the Hubble
Frontier Fields clusters. The purpose of this object injection is pipeline characterization
(photometric biases and performance characterization) within [PUFFIN](https://github.com/amendochka/PUFFIN)
